### Philosophy

+++

### Philosophy

- **Unix Philosophy:** Highly composable, modular components.
- **Entity Component System (ECS) model:** Partition data by behaviour, as opposed to object state.
- **Multi-threading:** Drives design to support parallel processing of data.

### Features: Rendering

+++

### Features: Rendering

Currently OpenGL via `gfx`.

This will be replaced with `rendy`, backed by `gfx-hal`.

### Features: Asset Loading

+++

### Features: Asset Loading

**Asset:** Configuration / data loaded at runtime.

* Audio files
* Textures (aka images)
* Scripts

+++

### Features: Asset Loading

TODO: diagram "isn't is just `file.read()?.parse()?`"

+++

### Features: Asset Loading

* Asynchronous
* Potential for caching
* Hot-reload

+++

### Features: Asset Loading

Demo: Hot Reload

@size[0.6em](see also: [`warmy`](https://crates.io/crates/warmy))

---

### Features: Networking

+++

### Features: Networking

**Laminar:** Protocol built over UDP, with some TCP features.

**Repository:** https://github.com/amethyst/laminar

@size[0.3em](The code is *pristine*)

+++

### Features: Networking

Demo: `net_client` and `net_server`

<!-- unset AMETHYST_LOG_LEVEL_FILTER -->

```bash
./target/debug/examples/net_server
./target/debug/examples/net_client
```

### Features: Thread Profiler

+++

### Features: Thread Profiler

Uses the [`thread_profiler`](https://crates.io/crates/thread_profiler) crate to track time spent within functions.

```rust
// Sprinkle this everywhere
#[cfg(feature = "profiler")]
profile_scope!("transform_system");
```

+++

### Features: Thread Profiler

Open `thread_profile.json` at `chrome://tracing`:

### Features: Test Automation

+++

### Features: Test Automation

```rust
#[test]
fn my_system_does_something() -> Result<(), Error> {
    AmethystApplication::blank()
        .with_system(MySystem, "my_system", &[])
        .with_setup(|world| {
            // ..
        })
        .with_assertion(|world| {
